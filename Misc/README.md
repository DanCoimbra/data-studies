# Misc
Data manipulation and numeric computation that does not fit elsewhere.

* [Natural Number Operation Tree](Natural%20Number%20Operation%20Tree)
  * Generates a pickled Python tree object. As any tree, that object contain relations between nodes. The nodes are either a natural number or an ordered pair of natural numbers. The relations are operations: '+' applied to (2,3) produces (5), 'âˆš' applied to (9) produces (3), '**' applied to (3,3) produces (27). All possible relations obtained through some 15 operations are stored in the list. However, excessively large operations are not computed, and as such the tree is bounded and has fit into a 12MB binary file.

* [OpenPyXL Project](OpenPyXL%20Project)
  * Uses the OpenPyXL module to rearrange and preprocess a huge .xlsx database on vehicle cost. The data was not analysed at this juncture. The aim was to aid a large company who had their own vehicle fleet and was attempting new data visualizations to figure out how to minimize costs. The database itself is private corporate information.
