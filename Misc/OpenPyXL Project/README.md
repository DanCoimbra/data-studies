# OpenPyXL Project
Uses the OpenPyXL module to rearrange and preprocess a huge .xlsx database on vehicle cost. The data was not analysed at this juncture. The aim was to aid a large company who had their own vehicle fleet and was attempting new data visualizations to figure out how to minimize costs. The database itself is private corporate information.
